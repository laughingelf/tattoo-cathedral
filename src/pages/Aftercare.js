                    Clean your tattoo. Remove the bandage after three (3) hours, but no more than twelve (12).
                    DO NOT remove the bandage until you can properly clean the tattoo with mild soap (Opti-Scrub Antimicrobial Soap)
                    and warm water. Rinse it well with cold water, thoroughly cleaning off all of the slimy coating that may have formed over the tattooed
                    area while underneath the bandage. Gently pat it dry with a clean paper towel, then allow it to air-dry
                    for ten (10) minutes.

                    Apply healing ointment to the tattoo. Sparingly, but thoroughly, massage a very small amount into the skin to keep the tattoo slightly moist, but NOT
                    smothered. Use just enough ointment to give the tattoo a slightly satin shine, and blot with a clean
                    paper towel. Your skin will take in all the ointment it needs, so do not leave excessive ointment on the
                    skin. For the next three (3) to seven (7) days, clean and apply ointment to your tattoo every six (6)
                    hours, (about 3-4 times daily), blotting the small amount of excess fluid that may be secreted from
                    the tattoo in between cleaning. Ensure that extra moisture doesn’t get trapped under the ointment
                    by blotting and air-drying after every washing. Only apply ointment for as long as it takes for your
                    tattoo to peel or become flakey, usually three (3) to seven (7) days. When the peeling begins, the
                    tattooed skin will flake like a sunburn. AT ALL COSTS avoid picking at the cracked and flaking skin.

                    You are now in the peeling phase. DO NOT apply any more ointment. The area will become dry and itchy,
                    sometimes very itchy. A good quality, fragrance-free lotion (Lubriderm for Sensitive Skin) can now be used
                    three (3) times daily INSTEAD of the ointment. Repeat each day until the skin returns to its normal texture. If you feel a heavier lotion is required to prevent over-drying in between application (physically dry to the touch and not just skin that feels tight), you may switch up to a heavier lotion like Lubriderm for Normal to Dry, or Dry Skin. If you get any pimples in the area tattooed during this phase, you need to decrease lotion application times or switch down to a lighter or different lotion.

                    SCABS are the body’s natural way of protecting wounds while they are healing. HOWEVER, it is very important
                    to maintain the appropriate aftercare to PREVENT scabs from forming as they can prolong and complicate the
                    healing process which can lead to uneven healing and even scarring.The first signs that may lead to scabbing
                    often are moisture bubbles that appear during the first few days of a new tattoo, usually caused by negligent
                    cleaning or the over application of ointment. At the first sign of these, clean the tattoo thoroughly and
                    allow to completely dry. Do not waterlog (soak) the tattoo. Only apply ointment sparingly to the areas
                    of the tattoo that do not have bubbles, allowing the bubbles to dry on their own.If scabs do form, once
                    the tattoo is in the full peeling phase, sparingly apply lotion to the entire area making sure to thoroughly
                    massage and not over apply or soak scabs with lotion. Any developed scabs should not be picked at or prematurely removed.
